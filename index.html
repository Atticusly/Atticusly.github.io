                Hi! I am Isaac Law, a student at Bedok View Secondary School. I've been interested in technology and coding especially in the Cyber security and artificial intelligence sectors since I was young, as I was introduced to it very early on in my life. What truly sparked my passion for coding was a hacking incident I experienced firsthand. The feeling of helplessness during that event made me realize how much it can affect individuals, especially those who are not tech-savvy. This experience motivated me to work towards making the internet more secure, particularly for the elderly. In my free time I enjoy activities like

                  <p> To achieve my passion, as a very self-directed and independent learner, I have worked hard over the past few years to learn the basics of coding in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++ through free online courses like Harvard's CS50. As technology advances, my passion burns brighter, as I find the evolution of technology both interesting and exciting—there’s always something new on the horizon. This is a personal portfolio I have created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my projects, achievements, and CCA activities.

                        <p class="card-text mt-3">I joined the National Cadet Corps (NCC) when I was a Secondary One student in 2020. My interest in the NCC began when I was first introduced to the digital defence pillar during Total Defence Day in Primary Six. I was fascinated by how the military uses technology and coding to enhance our cyber security and prevent widespread attacks in Singapore. This interest, combined with my passion for cyber security, led me to join my school's NCC. At first, I felt a little lost as I did not know much about the NCC. However, I quickly learnt the basics and was able to fit in, befriending my platoon mates and teachers.

                        <p class="card-text mt-3">With some similar knowledge from my previous CCA in primary school, the Boy Scouts, I used my leadership skills, outdoor survival skills, and simple drills I had learnt to quickly rise up the ranks in the NCC. In Secondary 3 in 2023, my teacher noticed that although I was not particularly good at teaching people drills in the NCC, I excelled in managing resources and people. To improve my potential, I was nominated to attend the Senior Specialist Leaders Course, a programme where only a small number of cadets per level are selected based on their leadership capabilities to attain the Staff Sergeant rank. I completed the 3-day, 2-night camp, where I significantly improved my leadership skills, learnt new skills, and befriended even more people from other schools.

                            I was appointed as the Quartermaster of NCC due to my skills in managing resources. My abilities ensured that our CCA sessions were very smooth and efficient, as I quickly prepared, took care of, and returned all the equipment. I enhanced the itemization and preparation for kit exchanges, as well as the distribution of uniform kits to new cadets, by implementing technology like personalized forms. Initially, the technology did not work as well as I had hoped, but through learning from mistakes, it gradually improved. This has made the process of itemization and organization of uniforms and items much faster and easier for the current and future batches. During CCA sessions, when I have free time, I go around helping my fellow platoon mates by assisting them in teaching and fixing mistakes made by other cadets.

                        <p class="card-text mt-3">One of my cadet instructors created a group called the Cadet Specialist Course, which served as a test for cadets to rank up and attain the Sergeant role. I collaborated closely with the cadet instructor in the admin department. Since my platoon was not tech-savvy, as the head of the admin department, I had to teach them how to use simple codes and technology for tasks such as organizing and marking test scripts. Additionally, I created and organized the Google Drive used to document, store, and mark test scripts submitted by the cadets. This experience has significantly improved my leadership skills and deepened my understanding of how technology is used by non-tech-savvy individuals. It has also inspired me to find ways to make the internet a safer space for everyone.

                        <p class="card-text mt-3">On July 1, 2023, my platoon completed a community service project in collaboration with Willing Hearts, a charity organization that operates a soup kitchen preparing and distributing approximately 7,000 meals daily to the needy. Our platoon assisted by unloading supplies, washing and preparing food for cooking, and packing the cooked meals.  From this experience, I realized the significant time and effort required to feed the needy. I spent three hours cutting vegetables for later cooking and another three hours spreading butter on bread to be packed for distribution. This made me appreciate the effort involved in cooking, packing, and delivering meals to those in need. It also reminded me not to take my current privileges for granted, as I am fortunate to have food on my table every day.

                            After three and a half years in NCC, it was time to step down to focus on my O' level examinations. Throughout this period, I learnt many new skills and formed numerous friendships. I came to understand that not everyone is equally fortunate and that each person is unique, with their own set of strengths and weaknesses.
                            
                            I also realized the importance of patience when teaching others, and the necessity of exploring different teaching methods. Serving as a quartermaster was particularly challenging, as I had never before managed such a large amount of equipment and people simultaneously. This role broadened my experiences, exposing me to many challenges and situations I had never encountered before. It significantly enhanced my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
